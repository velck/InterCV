# InterCV

InterCV stands for Interactive Curriculum Vitae. 
It is an HTML document written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
and intended to become an interactive account of my professional history, featuring lessons I learnt therefrom. Also featuring a special section dedicated to a prospective employers the document could be sent to. This customizable section will make an effort to convince the employer of how suitable I am for a position in question.
