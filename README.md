# InterCV

InterCV stands for Interactive Curriculum Vitae. 
An HTML document written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Intended to become an interactive account of my professional history, featuring lessons I learnt therefrom. Also featuring a special section dedicated to a prospective employer the document could be sent to. The section will make an effort to convince the employer of how suitable for a position I am. 
It is intended to be hosted on a personal domain. 

The project has several aims: 
1. To code a webpage with a decent responsive design.
2. To learn recursive JavaScript functions that deal with DOM.
3. To learn the event concept in JavaScript. 
4. To learn how to use the iframe element. 
5. To create my first JavaScript objects.
